Dice the @yellow onion{1}, @bell peppers{2}, and @jalapeño{1}

Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the @pasta{8%oz}. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until tender. Drain the pasta in a colander and set it aside until ready to use.

While waiting for the pasta to cook, heat 1 Tbsp cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the @meatless crumbles{1.5%packets}. Sauté the crumbles until slightly browned. Remove the crumbles from the skillet to a clean bowl.

Add the onion, bell peppers, and jalapeño to the skillet and continue to sauté over medium heat just until they begin to soften slightly on the edges and have a little brown color. Add the @fajita spice mix{1} and sauté for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant. Add the @fire roasted diced tomatoes{1%can} and the @cream cheese{4%oz}. Stir the mixture over medium heat until the cream cheese melts in and forms a creamy sauce with the tomatoes.

Finally, add the cooked and drained pasta and cooked meat back to the skillet. Stir until everything is evenly combined and coated in creamy sauce. Top with sliced @green onions{2} and serve.
