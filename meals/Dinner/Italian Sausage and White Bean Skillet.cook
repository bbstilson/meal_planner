Saut√© the quartered @veggie sausages{1%pack} over medium heat until browned.

While the sausage is cooking, rinse and drain the @cannellini beans{2%cans}. Once the sausage is brown and crispy, add the beans and some freshly cracked pepper to the skillet. Allow them to heat through.

As the beans are heating through, roughly chop the @spinach{8%oz}. Add the spinach to the skillet or pot in batches, gently stirring it into the sausage and beans until it wilts down.

Add the @red sauce{1/2%can}. Once the spinach is mostly wilted, turn the heat off.
